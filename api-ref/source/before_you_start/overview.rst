Overview
========

Welcome to *Elastic Load Balance API Reference*. ELB distributes incoming traffic across backend servers based on the listening rules you define. ELB expands the service capabilities of applications and improves their availability by eliminating single points of failure (SPOFs).

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on load balancers and associated resources, such as creating, querying, deleting, and updating a load balancer. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <elb_gl_0000>`.

If you plan to access load balancers and associated resources through an API, ensure that you are familiar with ELB concepts. For details, see section "Service Overview."
